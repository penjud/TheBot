    "Absolutely, referring to another module like betfair_client.py to manage session tokens dynamically is a much better practice than hardcoding the ssoid directly in your API headers. This not only enhances security but also improves the robustness of your application by managing session tokens in a centralized manner, especially useful for handling token expiration and renewal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that you have a BetfairClient class already implemented, which handles login and token refresh, you should integrate this class across your application wherever you need to make authenticated API requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration Steps:\n",
    "1. Instantiate and Use BetfairClient for API Requests\n",
    "Rather than creating headers in each module, use the BetfairClient to handle API requests. This ensures that the session token is always current and correctly applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modify API Request Functions to Use BetfairClient\n",
    "Instead of constructing the request headers in each function or module where you need to make API requests, modify these functions to use the api_request method from the BetfairClient. This method already includes the logic to add the necessary headers and handle token refresh if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Modification\n",
    "Suppose you have a function in another module that needs to make an authenticated request to the Historical Data API:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Direct API request with manually set headers\n",
    "def download_file_list():\n",
    "    headers = {\n",
    "        'content-type': 'application/json',\n",
    "        'ssoid': 'your_actual_session_token'  # Hardcoded or improperly managed token\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    response = requests.post(\"https://historicdata.betfair.com/api/DownloadListOfFiles\", headers=headers, json=payload)\n",
    "    return response.json()\n",
    "After: Using BetfairClient:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from betfair_client import BetfairClient\n",
    "\n",
    "def download_file_list():\n",
    "    client = BetfairClient()  # Ensure this instance is reused or properly managed across requests\n",
    "    endpoint = \"https://historicdata.betfair.com/api/DownloadListOfFiles\"\n",
    "    payload = {\n",
    "        # your payload here\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        response = client.api_request(endpoint, payload)\n",
    "        return response\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        print(f\"Failed to download file list: {e}\")\n",
    "Benefits of Using BetfairClient:\n",
    "Centralized Session Management: BetfairClient takes care of session tokens, including obtaining, using, and refreshing them as necessary.\n",
    "Reduced Code Duplication: You donâ€™t need to repeatedly write code for handling headers and authentication in different parts of your application.\n",
    "Enhanced Security: By centralizing how the session token is handled, you reduce the risk of mishandling or exposing tokens.\n",
    "Robust Error Handling: The api_request function within BetfairClient handles various HTTP errors, including session expiration, and tries to re-login automatically, which is crucial for long-running applications.\n",
    "By integrating and utilizing the BetfairClient throughout your application, you ensure that all API requests are authenticated and handled consistently, making your application more secure, maintainable, and reliable."
