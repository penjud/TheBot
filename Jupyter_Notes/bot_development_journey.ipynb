    "Bot Development Summary:\n",
    "Initial Setup and API Interaction:\n",
    "The bot was initially designed using Python and structured to connect effectively with the Betfair API using multiple classes and modules for improved organization. Key classes like BetfairClient were introduced to manage API connections, handling login and session management robustly to avoid issues such as the \"INVALID_SESSION_INFORMATION\" error. This class was later enhanced to support dynamic parameters and token refresh capabilities through a keep_alive method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Server and Lifecycle Management:\n",
    "Server functionalities were encapsulated within the BotManager class to manage the bot's lifecycle, including startup and shutdown processes, using HTTP endpoints and command-line arguments for user-friendly interaction. The server's functionality was refined to focus more on backend processes, removing frontend-related tasks for optimized performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Handling and Error Management:\n",
    "Scripts like extract_and_clean_data.py were created to fetch and process live race data, as well as historical betting data, which were then cleaned and stored in a PostgreSQL database. The BetfairClient was integrated into these scripts to improve session management and error handling. Additionally, solutions were provided for common issues like database integration errors with psycopg2 and API authentication errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Structure and Resources:\n",
    "The bot's codebase was modularized into distinct components such as strategy assessment and bet placement logic, enhancing maintainability and scalability. Resources such as the Betfair API documentation, Python's requests library, and Flask web framework were instrumental in the development. The project structure and major components were documented through screenshots and detailed in the shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Environment and Dependencies:\n",
    "Sensitive information management was addressed using .env files to store environment variables securely, avoiding hard-coded data. Dependencies and libraries like python-dotenv and betfairlightweight were crucial for environmental management and API interactions."
