    "using the knowledge from the text files attached and with the knowledge of the bot function and structure, provide the steps I need to take to integrate the use of strategies to assess their success based on historical data.  As you can see I have the historical data downloaded, extracted and cleaned.  I do have strategy files and model files prepared, though I want you to ignore this for now and create a new, simplified approach to assessing my strategies on historical data"
